                Angel care was started over 20 years ago i. the Aberdeen area by Gerald <br>
bendewald. Gerald had an elderly mother and found that there were not a lot <br>
of companies in Aberdeen that would go into someone's home And provide <br> 
Assistance. he had a passion for helping the elderly and believed that keeping <br>
them in their own home as long as they could was a Blessing. That's why he <br>
founded angel care home care giving services. <br>
<br> 
Gerald passed away in 20?? his wife tatyana continues With angelcare with <br>
the same passion and Dedication to the serve Aberdeen and the surrounding <br>
areas.
